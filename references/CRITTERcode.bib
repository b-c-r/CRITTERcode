	abstract = {1. Functional responses quantify the per capita consumption rates of predators depending on prey density. The parameters of these nonlinear interaction strength models were recently used as successful proxies for predicting population dynamics, food-web topology and stability. 2. This study addressed systematic effects of predator and prey body masses on the functional response parameters handling time, instantaneous search coefficient (attack coefficient) and a scaling exponent converting type II into type III functional responses. To fully explore the possible combinations of predator and prey body masses, we studied the functional responses of 13 predator species (ground beetles and wolf spiders) on one small and one large prey resulting in 26 functional responses. 3. We found (i) a power-law decrease of handling time with predator mass with an exponent of −0·94; (ii) an increase of handling time with prey mass (power-law with an exponent of 0·83, but only three prey sizes were included); (iii) a hump-shaped relationship between instantaneous search coefficients and predator–prey body-mass ratios; and (iv) low scaling exponents for low predator–prey body mass ratios in contrast to high scaling exponents for high predator–prey body-mass ratios. 4. These scaling relationships suggest that nonlinear interaction strengths can be predicted by knowledge of predator and prey body masses. Our results imply that predators of intermediate size impose stronger per capita top-down interaction strengths on a prey than smaller or larger predators. Moreover, the stability of population and food-web dynamics should increase with increasing body-mass ratios in consequence of increases in the scaling exponents. 5. Integrating these scaling relationships into population models will allow predicting energy fluxes, food-web structures and the distribution of interaction strengths across food web links based on knowledge of the species’ body masses.},

Many authors have indulged in the calculating the propressive increase of a population when no checks nrerc operating. Thus Huxley calculated that the progeny of a single Aphis in the course of 10 generations, supposing all survived,would “contain more ponderable substance than five hundred millions of stout men; that is, more than the whole population of China”, (in Thompson, 1929). Checks, however, do occur and it has been the subject of much controversy to determine how these checks operate. Certain general principles—the density-dependence concept of Smith ( 1955) , the competition theory of Nicholson (1933)—have been proposed both verbally and mathematically, but because they have been based in part upon untested and restrictive assumptions they have been severelv criticized (e.g. Andrewartha and Birch 1954). These problems could be considerably clarified if we knew the mode of operation of each process that affects numbers, if we knew its basic and subsidiary components. predation, one such process, forms the subject of the present paper.},

One of the basic components, termed the functional response, was a response of the consumption of prey by individual predators to changes of prey density, and it appeared to be at least theor ctically important in population regulation. Because of this importance the functional response has been further examined ii n an attempt to explain its characteristics. The analytical approach adopted required a predator-prey situation in which the functional response was basically simple and from which more complex types could be developed. An explanation of the basic response would then be the first step towards an explanation of more complex ones, such as those already demonstrated by the small mammals. Artificial predator- prey situations were devised which were found to meet these requirements, and the mathematical equation derived to explain the basic response also appeared to describe the published data concerning the effect of host density upon the number of hosts attacked by insect parasites.},

	abstract = {Several decades of dynamical analyses of food-web networks [1–6] have led to important insights into the eﬀects of complexity, omnivory and interaction strength on food-web stability [6–8]. Several recent insights [7, 8] are based on nonlinear bioenergetic consumer-resource models [9] that display chaotic behavior in three species food chains [10, 11] which can be stabilized by omnivory [7] and weak interaction of a fourth species [8]. We slightly relax feeding on low-density prey in these models by modifying standard food-web interactions known as “type II” functional responses [12]. This change drastically alters the dynamics of realistic systems containing up to ten species. Our modiﬁcation stabilizes chaotic dynamics in three species systems and reduces or eliminates extinctions and non-persistent chaos [11] in ten species systems. This increased stability allows analysis of systems with greater biodiversity than in earlier work and suggests that dynamic stability is not as severe a constraint on the structure of large food webs as previously thought. The sensitivity of dynamical models to small changes in the predator-prey functional response well within the range of what is empirically observed suggests that functional response is a crucial aspect of species interactions that must be more precisely addressed in empirical studies.},

The important parameter values discussed are the maximum rate of feeding (k); a searching constant (x) equal to the density of resource for which feeding is half maximal; and n, a parameter associated with the amount of "learning" exhibited by the predators. It is shown that when a low palatability alternate food is present the predator will increase both the total utilization (k) and the half-saturation (x) for the test food item being monitored, but will show little change in the degree of learning (n). On the other hand, when foods are changed from randomly dispersed to clumped in the habitat, the predators increase their total resource utilization (k) but decrease their learning (n) and half-saturation (x).The results are discussed in terms of the effect these ecological changes produce in the general behavior of the organism.},

An equation derived through an analogy with allosteric enzyme kinetics is given which will account for both Type II and Type III responses. The response behavior can be explained by three parameters: maximal feeding rate (F); an affinity constant (G) related to handling times, capture efficiencies, etc.; and the number of encounters (n) a predator must have with a prey item before becoming maximally efficient at utilizing the prey item as a resource. A discussion follows on the biological processes which result in shifts from Type II to Type III functional responses. Most of the learning processes involve changes in predator behavior associated with increasing encounters with prey, thus supporting parameter n as a major determinant in shifting thc functional response. Three hypotheses concerning the values parameters F, G, and n will assume under different ecological situations are posited: (l) food preferences will be reflected in an increase in resource-utilization efficiency (F) and affinity (G) and a decrease in values of n encounters; (2) a size ordering of the predators will result in shifts up in the resource-utilization efficiency (F) and affinity (G); while (3) increasing habitat complexity will generate decreases in n and F.},
